# Exercise 01: Create Sass folder structure

Stop the watcher (Control-C) if it is running.

After checking out this branch (ex.01.start), create a new working
branch and push it to your repo:

    git checkout -b ex.01.work
    git push -u origin ex.01.work

Do this *before* you make any changes.

### Do **NOT** start the watcher yet!

In this exercise, you'll create files for Sass to compile.

## Steps:

1. Create a directory `sass`
2. Move the file `css/reset.css` to `sass/reset.scss`
3. Move the file `css/styles.css` to `sass/styles.scss`

### **NOTE:** the file extension changes!!

**AFTER** you have complete those steps, you can start the watcher
(`npm start`). You should not get any errors, and
the browser should display our ladies.

If you get an error, raise your hand and a TA can help.

If you look at the ex.01.finish branch on Github, you can also see
what it's supposed to look like.

If you like what you see, you can save your changes!

    git add --all -v
    git commit -m 'my work on exercise 1'
    git push
